# Credit-Score-Classification-SVM-

The objective of this assignment is to develop an intelligent system that can classify individuals into three different credit score brackets (multi-class classification), in order to minimize the need for manual efforts. The proposed system will employ Support Vector Machine (SVM), which will be trained using data from bank users' basic information and credit-related data accumulated over several years.
